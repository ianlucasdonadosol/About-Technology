        <h1>Technology</h1>
        <h3>Technology has evolved a lot throughout the years. However, it would be interesting to see how things actually evolved. From over 50 years ago to today, we know that technology and everything that has to do with this concept has advanced and evolved in a very fast pace and it is not the same as before at all. Which is why you will learn today about the many different inventions that changed our world forever.</h3>

            <h1>Technology in the 1960s</h1>
            <p>In the 1960s, a lot of innovating inventions were released to the world, making these things very important to what we have today. Things like the computer mouse and DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory). However, one that stands out and is very important for what we have today is the invention of LEDs. These micro-lights led to the development of multiple things such as TV or phone screens. </p>

            <h1>Technology in the 1970s</h1>
            <p>In the 1970s, many new things were invented such as the floppy disk, a once very convenient way of transporting data wherever you wanted. There was also the invention of the first video-game in the world, called Pong, which was the father of all games existing today. Many more things were invented, such as the E-Mail, or the Digital Camera. It's safe to say that the 1970s was the entrance to a big era of technology.</p>

            <p>The 1980s were the start of a whole new era of technology, because at this time was the invention of many new video-game consoles such as the NES, or the Nintendo GameBoy, and was also when PCs, such as the MacIntosh computer were created. Other things such as CD, short for Compact Disks, were created which were very useful things throughout the upcoming years for things like video-games and just storing data in general.</p>

            <p>Ten years before the new millenium, and people were coming up with very innovating things! Many creations were made in between these ten years, and they were very important. Things like The PlayStation, and the GameBoy Color were made. However, more important things were made. For example, the thing you are using to see this website: The World Wide Web (W3, WWW). Along with this, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was made, which by the way is being used to style this website. USB, Lithium-Ion batteries, DVDs, this time was the golden era of Online Technology.</p>

            <p>The new millenium: the 21st century. The invention of Social Media took over the world by storm, as platforms like Facebook and Youtube were created. Wireless Networks (such as Wi-Fi) were created as well. The iPod and the WII were also created in this period of time. To sum things up, the new millenium was mostly popular for the creation of Social Media mainly, and many other things that are still useful for today.</p>

            <p>The 2010s were very interesting as to what was released during this period of time in the market, because a lot of things that are used to this day, in 2024, are very useful. Things like 4G and also 5G were invented, so mobile data. With this, you can make calls and use apps that require internet data, when you don't have Wi-Fi access. Other things, like autonomous driving were invented, popularised by mainstream car producer and franchise, Tesla. There was also the uprising of AI (Artificial Intelligence), which really got popularised after the pandemic, COVID-19.</p>
